This is a writeup of my process through OSINT Exercise #002 by [Sofia Santos](gralhix.com). Check out her site for more exercises and blog posts about her experiences in open-source investigation!

The questions that need answering about the above image are as follows:

a) What is the name of the train station seen in the photo?
b) What is the name and height of the tallest structure seen in the photo?

The train station, based on the multiple signs in the image, appears to be on Flinders street. A quick search shows that this is Flinders Street Station in Melbourne, Australia, secondarily confirmed by way of Google Earth street view. In addition to seeing the station itself here, I am able to confirm the view of the buildings in the background. Google Earth’s 3D view ultimately saves me from having to find the heights of every single building in the picture, by showing the relative heights of each building.
From the photo, we have at least six buildings visible. If we look carefully, we can see signs on the buildings themselves that can be confirmed on Google Earth (IBM, HWT, etc). The ones that I need to know, however, I’m going to have to look closer for.

The first place I look is the thin spire on the left, as it seems to be the tallest of these buildings. This turns out to be Arts Center Melbourne, and looking around on some travel sites reveals that it’s 162 meters tall. There is another tall building that is potentially as tall as the Arts Center, but view does not show me the name of the building. Street view, however, gives me a name, and the associated website, on the ground floor window: FOCUS Apartments.

And that’s indeed the building.

Searching through the official website, I cannot find the height in particular, but I am able to find multiple news articles that place this newly opening apartment building at a cool 167 meters tall.

The answers, to sum it up:

a) The station in the photo is **Flinders Street Station** in Melbourne, Australia
b) The name and height of the tallest building is **FOCUS Apartments**, at **167 meters** tall
