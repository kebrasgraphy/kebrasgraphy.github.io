# README: or, an about
Writing to learn, thanks for joining me. 

Subjects of interest include maps and cartography, GIS and spatial analysis; linguistics with particular interest in corpus linguistics and West Asian languages; and issues of human rights and conflict. 

The former seem more conducive to this platform and the types of skills that might be interesting to write through, but I also like shooting archery; growing and foraging and crafting with plants; writing; various arts and crafts; and et cetera and I might try to write and photograph through some of those things too.
