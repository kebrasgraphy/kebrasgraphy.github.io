# an ABOUT
Writing to learn, thanks for joining me. 

Subjects of interest include maps and cartography, GIS and spatial analysis; linguistics with particular interest in corpus linguistics and West Asian languages; and issues of human rights and conflict. Currently working on learning Python to mess around with some of the aforementioned subjects.
