# An Intro

It's been a year since I've gotten sick.

That's not strictly true. I've had this illness for longer than a year, but a year ago marks the distinct decline in my health, and the time from which I did nothing but decline. No, that's not strictly true, either. I haven't done nothing but decline, and that's one thing that's so infuriating. Among a few things.

I don't know what the future holds, and I largely don't know what to do about it. There's not much I can do, both in the sense that its out of my power and I don't really have the energy. But! That's not why I'm writing this. I'm just setting the scene, I guess. None of the above is relevant except for that, and whatever external context where it may incidentally come up extemporaneous to various interests and endeavors. In fact, I largely don't intend to talk about it much beyond this (which, admittedly, may change, but these are my current intentions stated).

I mostly find that I have a lot of time on my hands. A lot of time that, ideally, when I can, when I'm not resting, I would like to use in ways that are personally edifying. So, here we go. I mostly plan on writing through processes on some projects and various attempts at self-learning, writing as I work through things. That's my obligatory intro, I suppose.
